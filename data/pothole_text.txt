There are plenty  potholes  our street, so many that I think  entire street needs to be repaved.  I've reported  mths ago, but nothing has happened.  As  is a culdesac, wh many homes that have short driveways, we have many residents that park ir car in  driveway and blocking  sidewalk. This results in people walking in  street vs   sidewalk.  We have two homes that are seniors, e in ir 80's and anor who uses a walker.  While I'm able to walk   street and not trip, I have to play close attenti to where I'm walking. And, I'm fearful a senior, a guest, or a child is going to trip   poorly maintained street, and get hurt.

Almost  entire stretch  Rancho Carmel Drive (from Carmel Mountain Road to  transi to Sabre Springs Parkway under  Ted Williams bridge) is filled wh potholes. We have been promised repair for several mths. I've persally seen roads in Mira Mesa that have been currently paved and had few, if any, problems beforehand. One in particular is Black Mountain Road (a 6-lane road) between Mercy Road and Capricorn. I never noticed  damage and problems that we see  Rancho Carmel Drive. Why Rancho Carmel Drive has been neglected is beyd me. Many residents have complained, and we have received nothing except lip service. I have a problem voting "for" when I see such negligence regarding  repaving   road. Please see attached pictures for a small sampling   problems.  I would like to know exactly when  will be repaved. Thank you!

Whin  last year some cstructi/maintenance took place alg Home Avenue where a strip   southbound lane (between 6" to 2' in places) was taken out   roadway and later filled back wh blacktop when  job was complete. The porti that crosses Gateway Drive   north side  Home Ave is still several inches deep causing an uncomfortable and unavoidable crossing each time as well as unnecessary wear and tear  vehicles. I would like to request that  6" wide strip be filled to be level wh  surrounding street. If possible, furr attenti could be given to some potholes  Home avenue to  south. Thank you.

Cy-hired ctractors recently completed a sidewalk job  35th street between Adams Ave and Collier Ave. While  sidewalks look great,  tie-in to  existing asphalt in  roadway fails to meet cy standards, so much so that my neighbor, who shares a comm driveway wh me, cannot pull into his driveway anymore whout damaging  bottom  his car. Per  Cy  San Diego's Street Design Manual, "All streets not superelevated shall be crowned at 2 percent" (p. 115). While I do not have  technical equipment to measure  cross slope at  aforementied area,  cross-slope is undoubtedly greater than 2 percent. During sidewalk cstructi, I requested wh  ctractors to speak to  RE. I was told that  RE was not available and that  issue wh  grade break would be resolved in  coming weeks wh a full roadway rehabilati. This discussi took place weeks ago, and I do not see signs  a pavement project. My request is to take measures to bring  street to standard cdi, at  very least as close to standard as possible. There is roadway work -going   streets nearby, though I do not know if y are AC projects. Perhaps AC work  my street can be added as an addendum em. Best regards,Amanda

The original order that I put in had  incorrect address. I replied to  email after  was marked closed but  order was never moved back to in progress.From Original"There is  large secti   road maybe 5' x 5' which I believe is turning into a sink hole. Over time  has been getting deeper and deeper. You cannot avoid  in  road as 's hard to see because 's large and if you do n you are   wrg side   road"UpdatesThis secti has now turned into a reverse speed bump. Basically s kinda like a launching ramp.

There's a huge pothole in middle  road.
The street is being re-surfaced in my area.  The repair crew said that  problem area @ 4365 & 4361 Argos Dr. has not designated for repair by  Cy Inspector. 's a low spot that's been eroded by moisture & standing water from  entire neighborhood, since re is no drainage in  immediate area.  The street level is approx 2-3 inches below curb level.  Even at 10a.m.  a sunny day like today, re's an inch  standing water ( gets higher.)  Throughout  year 's a problem &  breeds mosquoes in  summer.  A slurry seal ale, will not fix .  I ask that  Cy inspects  problem for repair prior to applying  slurry so that Cy mey is not being wasted.  Feel free to ctact me in pers or by phe & please leave a call-back number if I am not available to speak wh somee "in pers."  Thank you.

The people that use  lot are generally milary or USG civilian or ctract workers, but y live and pay significant taxes in  Cy, County, and State.  So although NMCSD generally has exclusive use   lot, you would think  Cy would have some interest in equably attending to s maintenance and not let if fall into  huge state  disrepair that  currently finds self.  Even filling in  potholes wh gravel would be huge improvement.  I can follow up later wh images if necessary.  But  is a significant problem for  hundred plus vehicles that must use  road every day.

Cross Street: Parkdale AveAround 6pm on Oct 11, 2016, I was driving on Mira Mesa Blvd and all  a sudden my car lerally shook like crazy.  My front tire was stuck on a  pothole that stretched along a large portion   Blvd.  I tried to swerve out  , but I couldn't due to  cars to my left.   is unacceptable to have such a large, long stretch  broken rode.  I attached some pictures to show how bad  is and even on one   photos you actually can see a car on 's far left to avoid  holes!  Due to  impact, my tire blew out and I had to replace  wh my son in  car at night.  I am concerned on how long  is going to be re whout anyone taking  responsibily to fix  so we can avoid even more  a serious accident.  I am fully aware   large amount  potholes throughout  cy and I understand  importance  trying to get to all  m, but  one is unacceptable and I am very upset at  inconvenience that I had to endure due to  lack  responsibily not taken by  cy.  I had to find someone to take my son, take time f work to get my car fixed!  Not acceptable.  I want to be reimbursed for  amount i had to pay to get my car fixed due to irresponsible behavior that can really injure someone or people.   boggles my mind that you all think that  is okay to leave a road like that for everyone to drive on!!! I want to be contacted immediately at 858-652-1375.  Sincerely,Summer Del Mundo

Pothole
All along



The parking lot at 3980 Lomaland Dr. is a San Diego Cy parking lot for visors who wish to access Sunset Cliffs Natural Park (SCNP) or enjoy  ocean view.  Today y cannot do so.  The lot is adjacent to Point Loma Nazarene Universy (PLNU).    This lot has served  Point Loma communy well for many years.  Unfortunately  Cy has not maintained  lot and due to  deplorable condion   lot,  Parking Enforcement folks cannot properly enforce  parking regulation at  lot.  The whe lines and red NO PARKING areas are completely gone.  As a result,  PLNU Staff, employees and students have taken over  lot.  The school physical plant is directly across  street from  lot and even though  is posted 4 Hour Parking Only,  plant workers park re all day every day.  Because re are no lines, cars park everywhere and ten block  entrance and ex to  lot.  If re was a medical or fire emergency, emergency crews could not access  park on most days.  There are very large pot holes throughout  lot and  asphalt is almost completely gone.   Please see att. photos.  This is not fair to those who actually wish to vis SCNP and presents a real safety hazard if re were to be a fire or medical emergency.   Besides ,  is a real eyesore and an embarrassment to  Cy.

There is no curb ramp at  southwest corner  Fort Stockton Dr and Hawk St. This corner is next door to a senior housing center (Green Manor), wh many residents that use walkers, canes, and have or difficulties wh balance wh walking. This curb is very difficult for  senior residents to step down into  crosswalk because re is no ramp. This is especially difficult for  residents that use a walker and people wh a cane because  drop down from  sidewalk to  street is too tall. There is also a large amount  broken asphalt at  corner causing trip hazards. Pedestrians currently have to enter into a driveway to access a ramp to  street since re is none at  curb. This adds addional risk because now y have to walk where cars are passing. The or 3 curbs at  intersection do have a curb ramp. Only  southwest corner does not have a curb ramp. This intersection is also across from an elementary/middle school so  ramp causes problems for young children while walking to and from school.

Many streets are being resurfaced in our neighborhood  week, which is nice. However,  looks like one   worst sections  street is not going to be fixed while streets that are in good shape are getting resurfaced. Potholes have been filled unsuccessfully several times on Highwood Dr. between Bisby Lake Ave. and just past Coleshill Drive.  Addressing potholes individually is not fixing  suation. The whole section  street needs to be resurfaced.  receives a lot  traffic from Gage Elementary and is frequently used by neighborhood residents.   would be much better to fix  part  Highwood than Coleshill, which is slated for tomorrow. Thanks for your attention! (I inadvertently saved duplicate copies   photos.)

There are many alligator cracks along EB La Jolla Pkwy in  #2 lane that will eventually erode into potholes.   is especially bad right after  Via Capri merge wh EB La Jolla Parkway.  There are 2 large potholes.  One about 1' in length and anor about 2' in length.  They are dangerous and will only growing larger in  rainy season.  Please fix soon!The signage on Via Capri is also dangerous.  The sign tells  driver to yield and I have only seen maybe 1-2 people yield in  17 yrs I've been driving along La Jolla Parkway/Ardath Rd.  The majory  people treat  as a "merge", not a yield.  The signage should be changed.  The speed  cars coming down La Jolla Parkway is too fast for a car on Via Capri to "yield" and n accelerate to safely enter.  The weeds have also grown high so that  is not easy to see if someone is merging from Via Capri onto La Jolla Parkway.  Please address.

To whom  may concern,On Sunday December 18th at approximately 9pm I was traveling down interstate 163S when I encountered  largest pot hole I have ever seen.  was near  6th Ave ex in  #2 lane I believe. Being that  was que dark and re is poor lighting on  highway I didn't see  pot hole until I had already gone over . By n  was too late. My tire instantly deflated and I proceeded to ex f Washington Ave West  to access  damage. That pot hole caused severe damage to my rims on  driver side  my car. My front left tire popped and my rim became mangled and bent.  also bent my left rear rim which may case issues down  line wh being able to retain air.  Due to  location   pothole on  interstate and re being no "real" shoulder to pull over I had to proceed to ex f  nearest ex.  I have contacted my tire shop and was told I will have to repair both rims and replace my front left tire which was deflated.   Wh  cost  car repairs and  pending holidays I am unable to get a new tire or rim repairs until  new year forcing me to drive on my spare until  new year. I implore that you fix that pot hole immediately as I feel  damage to my vehicle and my person could have been much worse. I'm sure you receive emails   sort all  time but as single woman living pay check to paycheck who pays her taxes to have things like  repaired ,se unforeseen issues don't f into my everyday budget. There is no excuse why re is such a large gaping hole on  interstate. Please fix  right away. If you  can help in any way  or need photos I would be happy to provided m.Thank you, Denisha Modkins619-513-9004

many, deep potholes on Georgia Street,  ones in front  my house at 4439 Georgia street has been patched many times but never repaired.  Cy Streets dammed up an area to  right  my driveway which now keeps  water in my driveway. The sidewalk apron has been undermined by  standing water.  Each time I complain, a truck comes out, spreads out some asphalt and leaves.  2 days later  asphalt is cracked.  Luckily no one has yet fallen but 's just a matter  time.  The intersection at Park and Mission is ALWAYS flooded.  The alley between Mission and Meade between Georgia & Florida is ten flooded due to an illegal car detailing business being run out  a garage at 4427 Georgia.  Enormous amounts  water are wasted daily.

Highwood road behind Gage Elementary School (92119) is riddled wh bumps and pot holes. All connecting roads have been paved around  in  last month, but for some reason,  road only did not get repaved although  was  one in most dire need. Today as I was walking my son to school, across  crosswalk on Highwood, my foot got caught in one   pot holes and I twisted my ankle and fell. I was holding my son's hand, so he also fell into  street wh me. This is dangerous for both cars and people, especially on a road that has lots  small child crossing twice a day, 5 days per week. Children could be hurt by falling, or unfortunately someone could be h by a car getting injured in  middle   road where re are a lot  cars and pedestrians all at  same time. This part   road is damaging to cars driving on m several times per day, but more importantly could end up wh injured parents and children in a zone that is supposed to be extra safe.

There are major potholes along Genesee Ave, whin a 1/2 mile  each side  Linda Vista Rd.  This section  Genesee has been in disrepair for months.  Last year a crew widened  turn lanes and I was shocked to watch  construction crews pack up whout repairing  asphalt.  The image I uploaded is a street view from Google Maps and you can see how bad .  However,  is much worse now due to  rains!  I drive  section everyday for daycare drop-f and  is a nightmare and an embarrassment.  Last year I had to pay $600 for axle realignment and I know  condion   roads in Clairemont are to blame.  Please, send a crew to Clairemont and drive around  neighborhoods.   is bad!  But especially  stretch near Linda Vista Rd.

The incident (Flat Tires due to Giant Pothole) happened on January 24th at around 8:45 pm. I just got f work and ready to head back home. I was going northbound on Convoy street toward  805 N freeway.  was fairly dark around that particular area and  pothole was located on  left lane nearby  waing zone. As I was passing by  plaza wh Tajima Noodle House and Friend's house Koren, and before  plaza wh Cake De Partie, I ran into  pothole and immediately my left front tire and rear tire went flat. From my perspective,  road seems smooth and flat, and I was driving around 25-30 mph. After hting  pothole,  "Tire Needs Air" sign popped up in my Volvo S80. I n pulled over right in front   Pacific Honda dealership on Convoy St. to check up on  damage. I was extremely sad because I was ready to head home from work and  happened. I am currently a student at Mesa college and I can't afford to fix my tires anytime soon. I am just hoping that whatever happened to me won't happen to anyone else.

Please note last two request 00106984 and 00118492. I emailed f   last closed request on 1/14/2017 wh no response and I understand all  pot hole issues in San Diego but my neighbors and I have been requesting help since October 2016 and we were told in was scheduled for November 2 2016 n  was reschedule for January 13, 2017 and as  today nothing has taken place. I advise  street  Broadway and 's  short span that was never resurfaced but  or end was twice and I know y replaced pipes  second time. However from Madera to 65th 's so bad you feel like you are going f road, my tire and alignment are not good and just had m done not to long ago. This portion has public transportation that come through ir several times a day which I'm sure doesn't help. We feel kind  hopeless when you're given dates and nothing has happened. Please understand I'm not going to take pictures  that area because you come and drive  to see how bad  is. My neighbor across  street does like to drive his motorcycle because he is afraid. Can we get some kind  help? I think y might have placed a ltle tiny patch but 's already been broken up again. Thank you for your time and efforts!

I want to thank  street maintenance crew for getting out so quickly to patch  pothole in  crosswalk at  norast corner  Lincoln Street and Park Blvd.  An cold-rolled ATB mix was put down over  alligatored asphalt that failed from heavy bus traffic and a slink hole about eight feet (8') north to south and four feet (4') east to west, to a depth  four to eight inches (4"-8").  This was a very significant safety problem for sight impaired pedestrians and could also cause loss  control and/or damage to a vehicle.I do want to make sure that  section  heavily use street in North Park gets a properly engineered repair.  The subgrade material that washed away should be stabilized, a concrete slurry poured in and smood and n capped wh at least two inches (2')  Portland Asphalt Concrete or better.

As I was right behind and was not able to escape some   pebbles punched a hole in my AC condenser causing a major damage. As a result my AC is not working and needs a replacement   condenser wh all   surrounding parts. The estimated cost is $650 wh labor. I think  is a major hazard to leave a hole in that condion. I'm really not in posion to pay that amount to fix my car.Please advise.Best,Davor

I was driving in  right lane on Saturday night to go to Burlington Coat Factory to pick up a friend from work 15 minutes to 8:00pm and I notice that my right front tire h a pothole. I didn't think nothing   until I started hearing my tire flopping. I tried to go to  gas station near by to put air in my tire but that didn't work. The only choice I had was to park  at a near by friend's house. My friend asked some coworker's if y had a spare tire. They didn't. I had to wa until  next day (Sunday), to see if he could helped me get a tire. Anor friend and I went to get  spare tire from J & M Tire Shop on 28th and National Ave in San Diego. We purchased  tire from  mechanic (Oscar) for $45.00. My friend she took me to buy  new tire, n  we drove back  wh anor friend following us to  location where  car was parked at, so he could put  new tire on  car.
Several weeks ago I reported potholes from  2700 block  Morningside to  2900 block  Morningside. I recieved an E-Mail that work had been completed and that report had been closed. One pothole was filled in front  my parents home (2965 Morningside). The rest   potholes were left untouched. Morningside has not received any repair in approximately 15 years and from 2700 to 2900 block is completely crumbling. I am uploading photos for your perusal and  hopefully will make  determination that more than one pothole need's to be filled. Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to  long endured disaster.

The complaint I have is, for a road that was repaired, and what looks like y laid down concrete side walk materials, instead  using  correct roadway pavment.

Already we all live on a busy street, but  extra noise   is que annoying ,wrong, and unnecessary noise. I would appreciate someone to come take a look to fix  matter please. I have spoke wh surrounding neighbors who have noticed to. Please feel free to contact me for updates or questions.

There are tons  potholes all  way up and down Gold Coast Dr, especially between Camino Ruiz and Black Mtn Rd. I frequent Gold Coast on my daily commute to and from work, and  potholes are absolutely horrible! There is an elementary school and a middle school right f  Gold Coast, along wh  college at  end   street. The potholes are extremely large and deep and have caused serious damage to not only my car's suspension/tires but my neighbor's as well.  seems that every time y fill m, 's just a cheap band-aid and  filling only lasts for a couple  weeks. There has to be something that we can do about se horrible potholes that are dangerous for us to be driving over, as y are near impossible to avoid wh  single lane in each direction. About a year back, y paved a lot   side streets f  Gold Coast, but y never paved over  main road and 's only getting worse! Please fix m as  causes a danger to  neighborhood as people are cutting into  or lane that travels in  oppose direction since y are trying ro avoid hting se deep potholes.

Also,  street is extremely steep and requires a concrete surface, but  patch was done in asphalt.When all  San Diego is asking for smoor streets,  is inconceivable that  street repair makes  street WORSE than  was previously.Many years ago, I worked for Pacific Gas & Electric in Oakland, and after we dug up a street, we repaired  wh an absolute smooth surface AFTER thoroughly tamping down  ground and  asphalt.   can be done and must be done by every vendor digging up our streets.

There are 2 huge potholes here that flattened two  my tires on  passenger side  my car. On March 1, 2017 at approx. 3:15 pm I was travelling home from work going west on N Harbor Drive. By  time I noticed  potholes, I could not swerve into  number 1 lane because re was a car re. I h  2 potholes and immediately pulled over to a popped tire in  front and  rear tire was sl.  eventually deteriorated not long after. The front rim is damaged as well. The only good thing for me is y are run flat tires. However, y are very expensive, so I had to buy used tires. 's not right or fair because I just got  car a few months earlier and  tires were almost new but y are not covered under  Certified Pre Owned warranty. Potholes are all over San Diego and I have h a bunch but I wasn't aware   reporting webse until recently.

The parking lot entry is in horrendous condion. There are large potholes, cracks, and fissures everywhere. The condion   parking lot has slowly been getting worse and worse, re have been complaints for years.Unless you have a SUV, you car can bottom or you hope your car is wide enough to straddle  ginormous potholes at  entry   parking lot.  A friend  mine drove into  parking lot and  holes were full  water from  rain a few weeks ago- and her Prius got stuck, because she was unaware  holes were so large.  This park is so neglected and  is an embarrassment to my son's sports organization when we have vising clubs- and  cy should be embarrassed as well.    Please fill in  potholes, or repave  entire lot.   We shouldn't have to risk damaging our cars when vising a cy park!

A trench was cut across  roadway. The material used for backfill was left low and is eroding making  even lower than when  was first placed. The sharp edges and deep depression in  roadway make for a road hazard for bicycles. Not sure why contractors are being paid to do such shoddy work.
A multude  poorly backfilled trenches have recently appeared on Universy Avenue in both directions. The backfill appears to be poorly compacted. The asphalt trench caps are loose and unraveling, low and have sharp edges. Trenches that run longudinally wh  roadway are especially hazardous to bicycle riders. Furr, trench plates covering portions   work extend above  roadway wh exposed sharp edges, also a roadway hazard. Beyond , pipes have been left exposed above  roadway, some are leaking. Ors are broken. This has left a gallery  obstacles which can cause accidents and damage to bicycles. These condions are definely not bicycle friendly.

This is more than a pot hole.  These are ruts so large that if anyone fell into m  could possibly cause a serious injury to ir ankle. Residents in  area are sick   damage that  is doing to ir cars and someone has taken  upon mself to fill  hole wh sand. This is not only making a bigger mess but also poses a serious injury for motorcycles and bicyclists.  My mor is 81 years old and she has asked no less than 4 times for  street to be not just repaired but repaved.   seems that less traveled streets including cul de sacs that didn't need repair have taken priory to  much traveled street she lives on. I think that  street was just missed altoger as  has been many years since  has had any attention.  How are  streets priorized? Does a supervisor ever come out to take an assessment   qualy   street.  I can assure you , should my mor fall and break a hip or hurt herself in any way  cy will be found responsibe for her injuries and will have a lawsu on ir hand.  Wouldn't  be more fiscally prudent to make  repairs as requested? PLEASE fix  street.

Finally after 10 years  complaints  cy resurfaced  street (Bisby Lake Ave.) in front  Gage Elementary in San Carlos (and some   surrounding streets). HOWEVER, you neglected to resurface THE WORST street in  neighborhood which children and parents use daily- HIGHWOOD DRIVE located on  side entrance  Gage Elementary. The street, from one end to  or (about 3/4 mile ss between Boulder Lake Ave. and dead ends East. This street is HIGHLY used all times during  day and night because   lack  stop signs. And because parents and students are limed to parking in front  Gage Elementary-  street is used as an alternative pick-up and drop-f se.  That said:  crosswalk street markers are faded (if not all but gone), rocks shoot onto neighbors yards, people trip over potholes when crossing  street, dogs get concret stuck in ir paws and cars have tires busted!!! The worst   street is between Boulder Lake Ave and Hudson Dr. Even when Bisby Lake Ave. was finally resurfaced and a proper cross walk was put in on  corner  Highwood Dr. and Bisby Lake, in speaking wh  street crew- y could not believe that Highwood drive was not on ir list!! Instead- y painted right over rocks and pots holes to put in a cross walk. So we FINALLY got a crosswalk but no signage on  road alerting drivers to be cautious. We need a speeding sign due to  many many parents, young drivers and people rushing home on a daily basis who run stop signs on Coleshill Dr. and speed along Highwood Dr. Someone or a pet is going to get killed!  Come on out to San Carlos about 1:30pm or 7:30am- Take Navajo Rd. to Boulder Lake Ave. (North), n turn right onto Highwood Dr. and come s in front  8522 and survey!

Subject: Re: Growing Pothole on  Jutland Drive freeway to Costoco RE: Pothole at Jutland Drive & Aber StDear Adrian: I regret to inform you that  pothole fronting our home, recently repaired has reappeared! Regrettably because   rains and  heavy (overweight) trucks that trans Jutland Drive to/from Moreno Blvd. to Clairemont Mesa Drive/Regents Road have provoked  deterioration   carpet. This one is slightly larger than  previous one, and will continue to grow as  moves from  Aber St. direction to  Moreno direction (i.e. from East to West). The earlier repair is still in place but  carpet is disintegrating as  moves in a Westerly direction. I would suggest to  carpeting repair department that  repair requires attention along  entire area  disintegration. I will have my wife send you a foto so that s repair is done sooner rar than later.

The middle   intersection has a series  bumps/cuts and uneven surfaces after recent work  that has taken place to support  nearby housing neighborhood under construction.
Your map for  address is very unwieldy.  Unless  pothole occurs infront  a house, you can't GET an address.  This is at 28th and Redwood, just before you get to Redwood and Pershing Drive.  This isn't really a pothole.  This is an intentional cut in  pavement extending fully across two lanes  travel that is unavoidable.  The cut starts at  Street Light box suggesting that eir  Cy or a contractor hired by  Cy was responsible for  man-made driving hazard.  This has been like  for AT LEAST A MONTH and I've already got a flat tire from .  I CANNOT AVOID CROSSING THIS CUT IN THE PAVEMENT unless I go several blocks out  my way.  People who aren't from  neighborhood and encounter  have no advance warning - re are no cones or signs alerting drivers to  hazard.  There is loose gravel THAT WAS ADDED that makes  worse.

This road is pretty bad wh multiple potholes, but pothole coming down  hill on Clairemont drive is a serious hazard -- enough to bend a car rim at 40mph.

This is a $500 repair altoger and I could imagine that dozens  cars everyday day could also be falling victim to  road hazard. Please repair  as well as  assorted or potholes on  1/4 mile strip  Clairemont drive.

In general, part   Washington str (from Hancock str to San Diego Ave) is in very poor condion. The amount  traffic and  usage  that road leads to faster wear and tear, thus  needs more ten repairs. I didn't even mention  biking experience through that part   Washington. 's mind-blowing!Hope you can help make  a smoor experience for hundreds  people who take that rout:)

Heading South on North Torrey Pines Rd.  from Torrey Pines Scenic Drive to Expedion Way re are too many to count.  Not as bad as  or side  N. Torrey Pines.

I'm listing  in  Pothole category, but 's more  a giant dip in  road.  's on Eastbound Friars Road, just west  Qualcomm Way.  There was recently construction done on  road, and now  repairs have left a huge dip in  road causing a lot  cars to bottom-out when y're driving.  There are lots  marks in  road showing where  cars have bottomed out.

I'm not sure why my reports keep getting marked in progress or completed. The potholes are still here and very dangerous on Genesee. My car suffers a lot.
Pot hole on  circular ramp northbound from ingraham caused motorcycle accident
The picture labeled "Storm Drain" is  source   water from 5952 La Jolla Scenic.  A worker from Water Utilies told me that  is not a drain in that water is meant to come out, not go in.  He claimed  water is from an overflowing fountain on  adjacent property. "Eastbound Curb" shows  water running east on LJ Scenic towards  intersection wh Rutgers."Looking East" shows  intersection  La Jolla Scenic (north is to  right) and Rutgers. La Jolla Scenic has a 90 degree turn at  point so all  visible street is La Jolla Scenic.  Note that  water actually appears to start in  middle   intersection.  Sometimes  goes all  way across and sometimes  starts in  middle even though  source is on  far (west) side.  My guess is that  water goes underground on  west side and comes up again in  middle before heading  rest   way across and down Rutgers.   is probably eroding  ground under  intersection.  Sinkhole here we come!"Rutgers Stop Sign" has Rutgers on  right and La Jolla Scenic heading north towards  cross on  left.  If you look closely, you can see  water running down  Rutgers curb.  "Intersection" shows  same intersection from  oppose (north west) corner. As I mentioned previously, re is also a constant flow  water coming down  west curb  La Jolla Scenic visible in "Rutgers Stop Sign" from beyond where  two cars are parked.  That water is coming from  back  a house on La Jolla Rancho.  I did not get any decent pictures  that problem.  However, if you look at "Intersection" you can see re is a significant amount  water uphill from  low point.  All that water is coming from  La Jolla Rancho house."Potholes" shows just some   potholes at  intersection.  A single 2 dimensional photo cannot do justice to  problem.

Hello,I live On Calle Mar De Armonia San Diego 92130.Our Street was in pretty good condion wh some minor cracks, but nothing major. The Streets were Slurry Sealed about April 18. The road signs said  streets would be reopened at 5:00 P.M.  day  work was to be performed.Well  signs were taken f  streets at 3:00 P.M. and  sealant was obviously still wet. Cars coming home put numerous gouges in  wet Sealant from just normal stopping andTurning into ir driveways.To make matters worse,  sealant on our street has not cured correctly as  has on or streets. As even today, I noticed several new gouges in our street from tires and if I stand on The raised portions,  gouges flatten out as y again, have not cured correctly.  Cars continue to  day damaging  uncured slurry seal by just backing out  ir driveways and stopping.Our street look like a mess now.Is  going to be corrected?Dave Tipton

On  North side   intersection  Lakehurst Ave and Coconino Way, re are several portholes wh a depth  4"-6" deep. On 5/8/2017 at Approximately 1930 hours, as I was turning west onto Lakehurst Ave after coming to a stop while driving south on Coconino Way my motorcycles rear tire fell into one   potholes as I was turning and accelerating onto Lakehurst. This caused  balance  my bike to start to fall and n pched my motorcycle and my body into  air and n slamming violently to  ground in a whiplash fashion. I sustained physical body injury, but my safety gear (helmet, gloves and jacket) protected myself from anything that could have been severe. My motorcycle however suffered extensive body damage as well as some mechanical damage. There were several neighbors who wnessed  happen and came right over to check on me.I would like to request that se potholes be filled to prevent anor accident. Had I been going faster than 10 miles an hour, I would have had to call an ambulance to take me to  hospal.I would also like for someone from  cy contact me so that I can find out how I can have  several thousand dollars worth  damage to my safety gear and my motorcycle repaired. I will send  to as many people as I can find since I could not find any easy contact number on  Cy  San Diego webse.Thank you,Joe Kearns619.203.3554SDyacht@gmail.com

Comments: If you were coming from around RB High School area down Carmel Mountain Rd towards  15 Freeway re are some big potholes by Conference Way cross street.  Right about directly in  cross street exactly.  There are some large ones in  middle land and left lane both respectively.  As you continue for 1 addional block closer to  freeway (West bound and a ltle South) re are more pretty large ones in  left lane and some in  middle lane too I believe.  's just 1 addional block.  So you are already in that area.  Just continue forward towards  freeway and you will see m.  On Carmel Mountain Rd. as you approach closer to  15.Email is a good contact for me if you need to reach me.  Thank you for your service and help.  joegamblesvegas1@yahoo.com

We have over six large potholes along our street and have contacted  Street Division agency numerous  times to report  problem. We, along wh our neighbors, have been contacting  department for over a year now and nothing has been done. tached are a few pictures   damage to our street. The problem isn't just one section   street but along  entire street and so  is difficult  "avoid" driving around  potholes. I have checked your Pothole Patching Schedule numerous  time and while our district is listed, no patching has been made (nor have we seen any   workers along our street). The whole street looks like  needs to be repaved. Please send out your workers as soon as possible as  problem is causing major damages to our cars. We will also be contacting  Council Member to see what she can do about  problem. Thank you.

From end to end Castellana Rd was used for  Project related  to  new water/sewer mains on Castellana Rd in La Jolla.¬† As  was happening March 3rd, 2017, we immediately contacted  fice, CSD, PW, Construction Management & Field Services Division to inform m that damage to  concrete was being done as a result   heavy and constant back and forth traffic  such heavy weight equipment used for  project.This  damage is a direct result   heavy machinery that was used.  We are disappointed to read supervising engineer Mr Clemens Wassenberg  ?-CSD, PW, Construction Management & Field Services Division?-email in which he re-frames  damage   as ?pre-existing?.  He re-directs  damage that was created by  water/sewer project to your fice, mentioning that  is outside ir project area and would have to be addressed by  Cy  San Diego?s Street Division. That ir fice is not authorized to use ir limed water and sewer project funds for street repair outside  project area.Due to  major damage,  ¬†Cy  San Diego is risking¬†¬†potential human casualties beyond extensive material damage, ¬†that is seriously jeopardizing drivers, bike drivers, and  safety  people who enjoy walking in our street.

Going S/W on Carmel Mountain Road in  right lane re is a very deep pothole.   is in  right lane.   is before you reach Rancho Carmel Road.

Frustrated that "people" South  Interstate 8 don't report pot holes or anything else.  Driven around se two holes for several  weeks.  Guess SDPD does not notice or report  holes y are hting.

DEPRESSION IN AREA RIGHT IN FRONT OF DRIVEWAY
Hi. I moved to San Diego County (Vista) almost 3 years ago from OC.  I used to ride to work on my bike at least half  time up re thanks to a great network  f-road paths.  I haven?t been doing  since I moved here because   increased commute distance (27 miles each way to Qualcomm), many hills, and lack  f-road trails and having to cross several freeway entrances and exs.  I?ve finally started doing  two days per week for  last month.  I?ve found a somewhat reasonable route, mostly along 101.  However, after I cut inland at Carmel Valley Rd, things go downhill ? and not in a good way J    Sorrento Valley Rd, both ways between Carmel Mountain Rd and  a b south  Sorrento Valley Blvd, is about  worst road I?ve ever ridden on.  The bike lanes contain dozens  dangerously negligent patches that have almost thrown me f my bike several times.  The only reason I haven?t destroyed my wheels/tires is that I have a beach-cruiser style bike wh huge tires.  Even riding in  auto lane, when possible, is a constant effort to zig-zag around patches sticking up or large cracks and holes. I tried to look up  construction and maintenance history for  stretch  road and found  document: https://www.sandiego.gov/ses/default/files/asphalt_overlay_history_20161201.pdf  appears that  road has had no work done in over 15 years and most   has been untouched for 25 to 35 years!

Ran over a pothole yesterday that actually popped my front right tire.  This is f India Street as you're going onto  I-5 North.  's a particularly bad location because  sneaks up on you, and if you h  going at a reasonable speed, you could pop a tire.  There's also no good place to pull over right re to fix a passenger-side tire, so I had to drive a ltle ways until I got to  I-8 East and pull over into  divide.   would be pretty bad if a motorcycle ran over .

The recent Bike to Work Day makes  an opportune time to mention  neglect   bike lanes and roadway in general along Poway Rd.The stretch  road from  I-15 to roughly Pomerado Rd. is in desperate need  street sweeping on both  east and westbound sides.  There are broken car parts and piles  road debris.  The real issue is that  road in that section is in total disrepair and falling apart.  That is a major issue, not to be ignored.  But  smaller problem that has a solution is  debris in  bike lanes.  All  ground up roadway and car parts end up in  bike lanes creating hazardous and unpleasant riding.  The cies  Poway and San Diego can arrange a street sweeper to pass  stretch  road once a month and  would go a long way to improving  road.I regularly bike and drive  way to work.  I have complaints about  qualy   roadway that I doubt can be addressed in a timely manner.   least take  relatively simple step to clean up  bike lanes.

This is a long crack in  road between on Kettner next to Crack Shack and  middle  Kettner.  My daughter actually twisted her ankle and fell while holding her baby and crossing  street wh a friend.  IMPORTANT- This is one  MANY issues.  This morning she just got anor flat tire from a pothole - her second in a month.  New tires - 2017 Mazda SUV.  My 2017 Mercedes had all FOUR wheels damaged to  tune  $1,700.00.  The worst was on Pac HWY south over  ride in  Sassafras ex lane.  A small dch.  This has become ridiculous.  I don't want repayment.Please put  money (I have a receipt if you want ) into resurfacing  roads instead  temporary fixes that degrade whin months.  I care about ALL  people in  cy.  The roads in San Diego are significantly worse than in states where I have lived, like Ohio and Minnesota that have freeze-thaw cycles.   has become degrading to  qualy  life and encourages people to buy more giant vehicles.  This can be solved wh good leadership.  's a real safety issue.  Please make fundamental changes to  process.  The present approach is apparently not working.  Thank you.

Asphalt resurfacing  was just completed on Udall St. The contractor worked on Tuesday, June 6, and Wednesday, June 7. On Wednesday,  lightly rained in  morning, so  job did not start on time. Instead,  job started after noon. As soon as  road was finished, detour signs were quickly removed even though  road hadn't hardened.  Vehicle traffic immediately damaged  road, degrading  surface, and tearing holes in  asphalt. The contractor did not properly block  street or ensure road hardness. This must be corrected.  The road qualy is very poor, despe  job completion two days ago.

Sorry guys.  There are between 10 to 13 potholes in  cement boardwalk between Lido and Ormond and  retaining wall. The potholes range in width  5 to 10 inches and have a depth  1 1/2 inches. They are visible until about 4 p.m. and can be avoided wh due care. After 4 p.m. y are shaded or s dark and would pose a risk to a pedestrians and skaters.

Pothole on Rhonda
Repave  entire roadway!  What is  delay? The cy webse said  was going to be done last October. 's now half way through June and still nothing. This is one   most heavily traveled roads in Carmel Mountain.  Forgot soccer cy! Take care   problems that already exist in our fine cy. This road is like driving through  Grand Canyon. People have resorted to driving in  bike lane to avoid  potholes and ruts. I assume  only way something will happen is if a bicyclist gets killed.  Get  toger SD. Let's get  done, like  app is named.

Yesterday, I filed a report regarding  deplorable road condions present to bicyclists on Clairemont Mesa.  Today's paper has  following article.  How long will  be before  happens to me???? ...........LEMON GROVE (KGTV) ? A Lemon Grove mor got broken ribs and chipped teeth after a violent bike crash along 69th Street.Rosie Vazquez says she was riding her bike down a hill near Dartmoor Drive on May 21 when she h a pothole and flipped her bike.She says  happened as cars began passing her.?A car passed and anor car passed, as I looked back to clear my path I didn?t anticipate bumping into  pothole,? Vazquez said.There were a few potholes on  street, so she wasn?t sure which one h her bike. Nearly a month later, she says her medical bills are adding up and thinks she needs to be compensated.?Pain and suffering, damage to myself, time f from work,? she said listing all  reasons why she hired an attorney.Her torney, Evan Walker, says  is not  first time someone has gotten hurt from a pothole. Many have come to him wh similar stories, asking to help m file a claim.?I would think that would be proper for  cy to upgrade s infrastructure instead  paying out,? Walker said.The thing is, ?s not immediately clear which cy maintains  road - because 69th Street falls right on  cy lines  San Diego and Lemon Grove.Lemon Grove?s Assistant Cy Manager and Public Works Director responded to 10News via email. The statement reads in part:?69th Street is a street that is located between  Cy  San Diego and  Cy  Lemon Grove.  The Cy has, in  past, maintained portions  69th Street. However, whout being able to access  Cy?s past project information at  time, I cannot speak to  actual location and if  Cy  Lemon Grove has treated . ?10News also reached out to  cy  San Diego, asking wher re is a joint effort in maintaining 69th Street. A spokeswoman said ? is possible? but y would have to check wh an engineer for more details.Walker plans to file a claim wh both cies next week.? shouldn?t be like ,? Vazquez said, referring to  condion   road.
The trenches that were dug for  recent work need to be properly filled in, creates for a bumpy road and sloppy work.
Not necessarily a pothole but street repair/attention needed on WB Garnet, right before approaching Santa Fe St. There are metal plates for road work, which I understand are needed, however y are too high and not smooth at  edges or not properly flush wh  street that  actually causes an unintended speed bump.  slows down traffic unnecessarily as  is on down hill and when cars h  metal plates, not good for car suspension, and need to slow down. There are or steel plates on Morena that are much better posioned so that cars won't be jarred when y approach.

Can  major damage   deep pothole next to  sewer vault lid be filled wh cold patch so  barricades can be removed?  This will give  Wastewater Division some time to get  trench repaired properly.

The South bound se on Hollister street (area code 92154), between Leon Avenue and Tocayo has a strip  unasphalted  space that is usually riddled wh big pot holes especially when  rains. This also creates traffic congestion especially when  school is open. The cars on  left lane to make a left turn block  cars that need to go straight ahead.This was brought up to your attention que a few times in  past years, but one   excuses n was that  was not in  budget. This should not create a significant increase in  budget as  area is not that big. When done, however,  will give safety and convenience to  residents.I hope something posive happens  time.Respectfully,Cynthia Day

The norast side   22nd and F Street intersection is a big mess  deep holes right at  corner as you turn northbound onto 22nd Street.   is a hazard for cyclists as se holes can "catch" thin bicycle tires and if one doesn't want to get thrown f her bike, one must veer straight into vehicular traffic.  In fact, a cyclist got injured at  very corner last week (approximately July 3, mid afternoon) and an ambulance, a fire engine, and three police vehicles were on se (what did that cost, by  way?  As much as a repair to  street?).  I don't *know* that she got caught in se holes, though I suspect  is likely.

The Camino Del Rio N road is a designated bike route. There are many bicyclists that take  route to and from work such as myself. However,  road (especially  west bound side) has SOOOOO many potholes. I got a flat tire here last week because I could not avoid  since cars zoom right past me on  road.  is so dangerous. People cannot avoid  potholes for fear  moving a b to  left and interfering wh vehicle traffic. This road is a bike route but  is truly a safety hazard. The potholes are most prominent on  road where  google maps marker is placed. More specifically from where  business Qualy Escrow is until San Diego River Garden in Mission Valley is. While both sides   road should be repaved,  west bound side is DANGEROUS for bicyclists who can't afford to move to  left   potholes during high vehicle traffic times.

Fixing our roads should be  #1 priory in a cy that has some   best wear and beaches in  nation.  The last time I saw a road paving crew in my neighborhood was 11 years ago!!

Fortunately a passerby came and fered me  needed assistance to move out   crosswalk.The intersection is heavily trafficked.

There is a big dip in  road in  southbound number two lane on Sorrento Valley Road as you approach  I-805.  As you are driving  dip just comes out  nowhere.

There was anor similar large dip on Friars Road which was repaired recently.

First let me say that your department works very hard at not doing a great job on southbound Cactus Road. Clearly re is a lack  pride in your work. I send reports and you close m whout completing  job. You recently closed my most recent report to fix potholes on southbound Cactus Road between Airway Road and Siempre Viva Road. tached are photos   holes you left UNFILLED. What is wrong wh you people? Do  job right. Repave  southbound lane.The road is heavily traveled wh cars and especially trucks. The cy is supposed to care about 's cizen's safety. Prove .There is one photo that shows  short distance I walked on Cactus Road to take se photos. All  se photos are  different holes. If I walked to entire distance,  memory in my camera probably would have filled up wh pictures  holes on southbound Cactus Road.

Addionally, some houses end up having no parking in front, because neighbors park re to avoid dches.  Also, some neighbors have to park on ir lawns to avoid  dches and refore have been getting tickets.  PLEASE fix  parking issues on Charles St!

Barnard Street from Bob Street is in a state  shambles, undoubtedly in large part due to  construction equipment used to construct  many apartment complexes accessed by  street. There has been some recent asphalt concrete placement, no doubt cold mix, to fill  numerous potholes. This street is in extremely bad shape and is very detrimental to vehicle suspension systems. A complete rehab is essential in  case, including recommended asphalt grinding followed by 0.3' to 0.4' AC overlay. Continued filling  potholes is not going to cut . Please advise as to  planning for  rehab  Barnard Street.

The contractor building  new twin towers on Texas, between Polk and El Cajon Blvd., has lowered  elevation   street, left a water or sewer manhole cover stickin up a good 4-5 inches above street level.  He needs to bring  street back up to  level  was 1) So re's no bump going into that block and coming out  .  2) So  sewer or water cleanout is NOT up above street level.  Why  inspectors allowed  to happen is beyond anything I can figure out.  Contractors have already left messes all around No. Park and  needs to stop.
East bound lanes  Universy Ave., from Park Blvd. to approximately 29th. Street, is one continuous mess  contractors left and is full  not only pot holes , but a really lousy patch job.

Why did  inspectors allow  contractors to leave  street in  mess?  I would like to see  street smood out as  was before  digging and crude patch job.  Thank you.

Street desperately needs to be repaired. The street had trenches cut into  by  cy  in  past and  repair job was not good. There are holes throughout  street which cause my kids to crash on ir bikes and scooters. The street is a hazard to cars, people, etc.   A neighbor mentioned y were going to repair  street mselves  because  cy has not come to do  repair. That is completely unacceptable in my eyes.
India and Redwood St. Very hard to miss in  dark.
There is a metal, triangle-shaped, cover that is loose in  middle   street.   says "Monument" on .  The cover is loose and so is  metal frame  is supposed to rest on.  Traffic hazard!!
Middle lane , west bound
Middle lane, just before bridge, westbound
Potholes still remain after case has been closed.
Street surface is deteriorating more than or areas in  viciny which have been resurfaced.  Cracks have turned in to potholes, potholes have been turning into exposed dirt depressions .  In addion,  stretch  West Pennsylvania between Curlew St. and Sheldon Ave. has problems along  sides.  On  north side   street, erosion  hillside results in soil on  street and interfering wh traffic right  way.  On  south side   street, re is not curb or sidewalk (by design, which is fine in my opinion), but  asphalt edge   street is crumbling into  lower grade below, which is a driving hazard.

There's not a specific pot hole but  whole road in general. Washington St between Pacific Hwy and India is horrible. The pavement is very uneven, most likely from  heavy amount  trucking coming from  Fedex and UPS facilies at  airport. There's also unused rail tracks at  I-5 S Washington f-ramp and east   I-5 overpass on Washington that are no longer being used that really should be removed. On  Washington f-ramp,  tracks are visibly loose and wrecking havoc on vehicle suspensions.I'm very surprised that  stretch  road is not in  future repaving plans because  has to be one   worst stretches  roads in San Diego.-Paul Garcia

This is really a street issue.  This stretch  street has not been repaved in decades and  looks to be ignored/overlooked again  round or repaving.   is not only unsightly, but also dangerous to bike riders and wheelchair folks.  I called  engineer, Graham Hufford, in charge   projects in our area and he confirmed that Landis between Pershing and 28th is NOT on  agenda.  Please send someone to evaluate and let me know  result.  Today, marks have been put in front  our house at 3667 Pershing, which I assume indicates repaving.  Pershing is in much better shape than poor Landis.  Thank you

Scripps Trail Road has fallen into severe disrepair and causes discomfort and injury to local residents due to a host  cracks, potholes, decaying asphalt, and a painted street stop sign and divider lines that have not been repainted in some time. Addionally, residents describe  area as being a heavy traffic zone for emergency services and local school-goers -  street is a prime arterial road and fairly busy. Yet,  OCI for  street self rates as "fair" or "good" in most locations, despe  fact that  road self, according to residents, hasn't received any slurry seals or repaving projects since s creation in 1981 (according to  Overlay History report).  The rating  67.4 may be too high.   very least, we should be able to do some pothole repair and inspect  road for future projects.

I'm referring to Kearney Villa Rd. between Spectrum Center Blvd and Complex Dr., and Clairemont Mesa Blvd and Chesapeake Dr. These sections  Kearney Villa Rd. have been torn up for about a year for water main replacement. This area has recently been covered wh a slurry tar coat. This surface is very poor and very bumpy especially along  portion that will become a bicycle lane. Before  contract is approved  should be inspected by  cy. While  looks smooth to motor vehicle drivers  is far from smooth and in places unsafe for bicycles.   is actually in poorer condion n before  work was started. I would hope that  expectations   cy is to have  road as good as if not better n before a contractor starts tearing  up.

Three large roads that serves as  major thoroughfares  through Tierrasanta are in serious disrepair and need immediate attention. There is no single pothole. These streets are riddled wh potholes and serious cracks that are destroying our cars.  The three streets involved are: 1) Clairemont Mesa Boulevard for 2 miles east  interstate 152) Tierrasanta Boulevard for 1.5 miles east  interstate 153) Santo Rd,  especially where  intersects Clairemont Mesa Blvd., Tierrasanta Boulevard, and Highway 52 These are major roads that haven't been properly resurfaced for decades and that is wrong! What are you doing wh our tax money?
Heavy rain overnight (1/9/2018) opened up a sinkhole in my driveway, where a newly installed Cy  San Diego sewer clean-out pipe is located.   is impeding my abily to back my car down my extremely STEEP/HILLY driveway.  Could someone please fix  suation, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE?  I called Potholes Dept  morning, already.PLEASE NOTE: A subcontractor for  Cy  San Diego did  original work to install  sewer clean-out, in August, 2017.  The contractor (Southwest Pipeline?) dug up  entire street, installed clean-outs in every driveway including our property. They promised not to damage our property, and actually did a great job reinstalling  pavers on our driveway for us, last August.  We know that y dug up over 10ft  dirt, to install that clean-out pipe, so 's not clear how deep  current sinkhole is, nor how badly  is eroding away, wh  rain...  Sincerely,Carolyn Lee (homeowner and Cy  San Diego taxpayer)

There are now more than one pothole and  blacktop is eroding quickly leaving big chunks int he roadway, a hazard for cars to say  least.
This street is riddled wh potholes. High traffic and rain don't help. Please replace and put a speed bump in at  same time! Thank you.

I shop at Costco allot and cringe when I have to drive on  horrible stretch  Morena Bl. Contractor needs to return and dig up all  new asphalt, do proper compaction and lay smooth asphalt again ! Please do  right  time. The old nice asphalt was just fine until  contractor ruined  road to Costco. Thanks !!!

After a recent rainstorm, several potholes have emerged on Milton Street between Illion Street and Dunhaven Street.  This segment  street was just given a slurry seal treatment not too long ago.  Even when re are no rainstorms, large potholes still form.  The amount  potholes is simply unacceptable and is creating a major mess.  Because   dramatic number  potholes and how rapidly  street has deteriorated,  is my hope that  Cy will conduct an aud on  contractor responsible for  sloppy, low-qualy street repair and hopefully bar  contractor from future jobs.  Also, I have personally wnessed what patch jobs and potholes have done to  street, and  has not worked whatsoever.  May I ask that Milton Street get resurfaced between Illion Street and Dunhaven Street?  Thank you!

POTHOLE TIRE DAMAGE
Was   telephone company that made all   cuts going across Florida, east to west, starting up by Robinson all  way down to Upas? EVERY single cut is only half filled! a regular passenger car cannot drive over se cuts at more than two or 3 mph whout risking damage. I have already broken two tires on San Diego's bad roads, and I cannot even drive across se cuts whout risking breaking a third. This contractor needs to come out and completely fill every single one  those cuts. ASAP!!! And that same contractor also needs to be followed up on every or cut that he is making in our cy, because obviously that contractor does shoddy work. thank you very much!

Since  is a very busy street that does not have a four-way stop at  intersection,  banging   metal cover bangs all throughout  day and night.  We have ltle children and  banging is disturbing our sleep.   is now a nuisance that is impacting our health, especially our children. Please reseal  hole cover as soon as possible.

Florida street has always been a major problem but is unimaginably worse now than ever before.  Since Burtech did s infrastructure work, ir asphalt fill has eroded, sunk to unsafe levels, and has left considerable gaps between  concrete.  This is unsafe for cars and pedestrians and needs to be repaved in s entirety.  As homeowners on Florida street,  street condion devalues all homes in  area and is unsafe. I have cracked my bumper slowly driving up  street due to  considerable potholes. This issue has also been communicated to Councilman Ward and Tyler Renner.

Or streets nearby have been paved - and repaved again - but  single block between Redwood and Thorn has NOT been paved for over 20 YEARS!  I know because I have lived here that long and have firsthand experienced  pavements deterioration!

Hi,I was wondering why  35th and 34th @ Madison Ave Improvements (CIP #ID S00922) only went from Adams to Madison on 35th. From Madison to Mead all along 35th  road is torn up in various spots along  sidewalk and curb as well as  streets, so  seems inefficient to put in  requests for all  potholes when  probably needs a resurfacing. Many children and parents walk and drive along  street to get to  elementary school, and I have seen two neighbors on bicycles pop a wheel on ir bike. We are a very bike-friendly neighborhood, except for  street between Madison and Mead on 35th. I am happy to provide pictures   location or add any more information. Thank you so much for your time!Sincerely,Haley Lesser

The entire cul-de-sac is covered wh cracks and holes. Cy came out in November and fixed one   major holes, but  street is horrible. My kids ride ir bikes and scooters in  street and ir tires are always getting caught in a crack or hole making m fall. I also have elderly neighbors who walk around  street on uneven ground. I?m afraid someone is going to get seriously injured, especially one  my kids. Something needs to be done to fix  street before that happens.

There is a walking/running/biking trail along Sabre Springs Parkway by Creekside Elementary School.  About a year or so ago a small sinkhole opened up just f   trail and caused some   trail to wash away.  Since that time  cy has put up a number  temporary fences to keep people f   trail but in all  time re has been no indication  a plan to actually FIX or fill in  hole (or at least  part   trail that was affected. In  meantime people have been using  trail wh no issues until  week when  cy was out wh a large crew welding up a more permanent fence.THIS is why many people hate government,  is a great trail and  answer to doing  real (simple) job  fixing something is to close  trail and ruin  for  hundreds  people who use  every week.  When I spoke to  guys doing  work  week y all - to a man - basically said  same thing -  fencing f   trail MAKES NO SENSE.So what is  plan wh  trail?

 entire road is worse than anything i saw just coming from Baja, Mexico.  's a sad state that we have  tax base that we have here and you allow an entire road deck to dissolve and become a constant dust storm for every vehicle  that uses  road.  's a travesty.  local govt is...  ...well.... just like all or govt.  too big, too expensive and can barely stay out  s own way.  HOWEVER, you just completely repaved both streets in front   school that needed NOTHING!  THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY FINE - MAYBE A 9 OR 9.5 OUT OF POSSIBLE 10.  and you re-did m anyway!!  you really need to get smarter about how you waste our money and look at something before you just throw money at .  why not look at  areas and roads that have no record  any service for 15 to 20 years.   area is chocked full  m and you don't care.  but i'm sure  taxes will go up again next year so you can have a retirement program that i could not buy even if i had  funds....

There are two areas on northbound Carmel Valley Road wh identical problems whin 50 feet  each or; you may wish to make  two trouble tickets...When Winecreek Drive was built last year, Carmel Valley Road was taken apart for utilies to be placed n put back toger (badly) in  two northbound lanes.Now each   two northbound lanes have  same problem, but not across both lanes at  same place.The problem for both lanes is that  roadway has settled causing a low area.  The low area is deep enough to marked as a dip, but  lower area is about ten feet from start to finish, not sudden like a dip.  The road at  point is 50 mph, and that's why  low area across  road makes cars bounce and drivers try to brake as y see what's happening to  cars ahead  m.The right hand lane's problem is about 20 fee south   intersection  CV and Winecreek.  The left hand lane's problem area is just before  intersection ends.

Pretty bad pot hole that has been re for a few days now...?s on  ex ramp from  8/163 when getting f near  mall, in  2nd to left lane.
*The concerns are directly related to  Cy  San Diego's Catalina Blvd utilies project.  On Southbound Catalina approaching Electron Drive re are far too many uneven surfaces and small/medium-sized potholes.My co-workers and I have lamented how frequently have had to have our tires balanced and  front end on our automobiles aligned. While we are reasonable and expect some degree  inconvenience, to include uneven surfaces,  Cy could and should act in a more responsible manner to properly fill in holes created by  construction project.  Ideally,  holes will be sufficiently filled so that  surface is even and refore resulting in less damage to POVs and unsafe, erratic maneuvers by drivers attempting to avoid  many holes left for weeks/months by  Cy.  We believe that Cy Officials would likely not want to drive ir POVs over  same roads each day. Thank you!

A few months ago  Cy replaced all  concrete streets in  Lower Hermosa track  La Jolla. The streets had been re since 1922 and  crew did an excellent job  replacing m. Now y are digging holes through  at  corner  Avenida Cresta and Via Del Norte. They house y appear to be doing  for was purchased well before  street  was redone and good planning would have avoided any destruction   new concrete. Any repairs need to be inspected for qualy to insure we don't end up wh an asphalt repair or poor qualy sunken repair.
The street has pot holes and multiple levels stripped away.   needs to be paved.
In  original report in  screenshot, Cy crews were not able to find  pothole. This I'm probably guessing due to  fact that re was no address number in  report. In  new updated report,  is  closest address number that I could find for  intersection  Genesee Ave & Executive Drive. Pothole self is inside  intersection in  sourn half  . If you need to contact me, and clarify  any furr, I'm more than happy to talk on  phone, just leave a message wh a phone number and I'll return  call. I do realize when  Cy calls, re's no caller ID info on  and I'm suspicious  answering those calls. Thank you.

Anor road where  entire portion should be an embarrassment to  cy and is an embarrassment to  communy.  's called "Scripps Ranch Blvd", and as a gateway to a neighborhood,  will ruin  cars that drive re.

My understanding from Neighbors that are original owners is that  street has never been repaved.  My two kids continue to fall in  street after having ir bike and scooter tires get stuck in  cracks. I hope  issue is resolved before a more serious injury occurs, wher  is one  my kids that falls or one   elderly neighbors.

On March 27, 2018 a new layer  asphalt was installed on Cayote Avenue, San Diego. After  work was completed I noticed that an area adjasent to 13044 Cayote Avenue was left wh poor qualy  pavement.  looks like  workers ran out  materials. So,  area is apoximately 4.5ft by 56ft, wh multiple ltle holes that start to dreak down.  Every day I see ltle pieces  asphalt pebels on my driveway. The pavement condion on  described above area, was in much better shape prior to  re-installation, than after  new asphalt was installed.
The street in front  my property and next door, 6275 Lake Lucerne Drive, is crumbling and several inches below  asphalt.

A letter was sent to all homeowners in  area.  stated  roads would be repaired after  all  sewer upgrade was complete, in March 2017. Nothing has been done in our neighborhood.

Local cizens use  roadway, to walk to Dubois, and to Cole, and on into  Clairemont Square area, and Post Office. The likely possibily  injury by bicycle and on foot is high, potentially putting  cy at financial risk.  would be a wise decision to repave  long block  inummerable potholes, for several reasons, as well as for Chris Cates to keep his promise to take care  all potholes in his area.

This was a very shoddy repair after a recent water main issue. I am not sure when  street will finally be finished wh all  work and receive a much needed repaving but  dip needs to at least be fixed now before cars are severely damaged or someone has an accident due to  impact  makes on each car driving over

Between I-5 and Eastgate Mall,  southbound bike lane areas are uneven and have vertical ruts that can catch a bicycle wheel and cause a crash.  There are new sidewalks installed wh gutters that do not mesh wh  asphalt on  road creating a vertical rise that can catch a bicycle wheel and cause loss  control. I am an avid cyclist, and have commuted to work (via bicycle), 2 times a week, for more than 10 years whout incident,  In  past month, I have crashed 2 times on San Diego roads in vertical rut condions.  First one was in Sorrento Valley, by  Coaster station (obsolete rubber track pads wh vertical gaps). No major injuries, but bloodied up.  The second was June 1, 2018, on Genesee in front  La Jolla Country Day school. Uneven pavement to sidewalk gutter, combined wh a square patch  "repaired" asphalt.  This time I fractured my pelvis.In my opinion, vertical road imperfections are a cyclists biggest enemy.  They are not always easy to detect, and are hardest to recover from.

The cy recently painted diagonal parking spots along  north side  Vickers Street.

More importantly, re are parking spots that were placed too close to each side  several driveways along  street making  extremely difficult to safely ex said driveways. When turning out a driveway,  is nearly impossible to see oncoming traffic in eir direction. When you do leave,  average sized car ends up halfway into  far lane. Many individuals, including myself, have nearly gotten in collisions due to  crowding on  street. Furrmore,  cy put in new parking spaces whout paving over  multude  significant and damaging potholes that cover  entire street.

Howdy Folks,In 2017 your managed to resurface most  Chateau Drive, and we certainly appreciate that effort.  that time re was a section  Chateau Drive between Paola Way and Camber Drive that did not get resurfaced. I assumed that was because some sewage or underlying road work needed to be done first.   is now June  2018 and  very rough strip  Chateau Drive has not been resurfaced. I expected that when recently or streets in  neighborhood were resurfaced that  small rough strip  Chateau Drive would be included.  was not.Is re any way that you will consider resurfacing  small rough strip  Chateau Drive in  near future?Sincerely,Dale L.

Huge pothole.
Camino Del RIo North from Qualcom Way to 3111 Camino Del Rio N 92108 is filled wh so many bumps that  is very hazardous. I did not feel safe on a bicycle and now that I am riding a scooter,  is perilous. I know that re is new construction, so  streets are being torn up and eventually will get repaved. However,  large bumps that are temporary "repairs" are not safe. Is re any way  Cy could inspect  pavement after street work by contractors, building for private industry? The cy is covered wh se hazards- far worse than I have ever seen. The private contractors are not ensuring safe temporary pave overs, They should be held accountable. I must ride my scooter to work, I have no choice to ride  road, but before I go flying due to se bumps and get hurt. I wanted to try to alert  cy to  terrible danger. Please demand safe repairs/ repaving, 's a matter  life and death to we who must drive scooters, bikes or motorcycles Thank you,

I attempted (9:30 PM) to turn left onto Euclid from  framp  94.  I ended up wh one tire tire ripped open as I crossed  divider.  If that pothole had not been re I probably would have just gone up and over and been just fine, but wh  pothole "catching" my tire, I instantly had a flat, had to call for roadside assistance and n had to acquire a new tire.  Please fill in  pothole as soon as possible.  Some reflective paint on  curb edging   center medium would be helpful also.

Please troubleshoot and repair. Please use a better repair method than paving asphalt as re is a lot  heavy truck traffic that will tear up any temporary repair quickly. I filed a report wh  county # DPW2018-TRNGEN-SREQ-04286, I received a call from someone at phone # (858) 285-6020 and y said that section  road is  Cy's and that  Cy says that section  road is  counties. What isn't fair is that  tax payers, like myself, suffer in your debate over who's road  is to maintain and repair.  isn't fair. This road is becoming increasingly less safe to drive and vehicles could start to have increased damage to suspension and tires.

In  San Diego border  Scripps Poway Parkway re are about thirty man hole covers that are in  west bound lane, and several in  eastbound Lane. They  are way too deep.  The more you pave  street,  deeper y get. 's a disaster driving on  street you have to maneuver around  manholes. They're definely destroying car suspensions. They jar  hell out  you when you're driving and scare  crap out  you. And y also create a safety hazard because people are maneuvering to get around m.  You should put a spacer on top   potholes or use larger Lids to meet  ground level. Or you could put asphalt on top   lid like I've seen many or places do. So we're not banging into se manholes as we drive to work, 's ridiculous re's no excuse for .

I am requesting that our alley be paved. Although my address is on 72nd St, which is paved, we are on  corner  Saranac alley that is not paved.  is a dirt alley. During rainy times,  dirt washes down onto our property and into  street. For  past year or more, re has been  construction  new condos down  alley. The heavy machinery has torn up  street more than we have orwise experienced in 11 years  ownership here.  has also damaged our paver stone parking spot and our block wall. I have wnessed some  se extremely large vehicles scrape up large divots in  alley. This week,  looks like y may be paving  very small section directly in front   condos, but we have not heard anything about  part   alley that we and many neighbors have to drive on, park on, and live on every day. Our part   alley that has always been a b troublesome has now been torn up by  heavy machinery and will experience much more traffic once  condos are completed.

While driving home Friday night (10/12/18) in  rain wh my two kids (13yrs and 8yrs old), I struck a massive pothole wh my 2011 Nissan Leaf, which blew out both  my right-side tires. After having  tires replaced, I discovered  right-front strut has also been severely damaged.  was brought to my attention today that  Cy  San Diego has a program for reporting potholes and filing claims. For  reason, I am completing  today. Also, due to just now finding out  information, I've not had  opportuny to go back and take photos. However, based on  extreme size   pothole, I expect  probably has already been repaired.  Scott Forrest (858)605-0095

South east corner  Draco and Gemini in Mira Mesa.This pothole is a problem child and is frequently fxed.  was repaired only a few weeks ago, but is already reforming. I think  problem may be that  spot is almost always wet; re is a constant stream  water discharging from a nearby apartment/condo complex and you can see algae growing in  gutter. That being said I am not a street engineer, but perhaps one needs to take a look at  suation. Maybe  solution is concrete in  gutter   intersection.

A fairly large hole has opened up under part   alley behind my house and caused part   adjacent driveway to collapse.  The hole is under  concrete alley almost directly under where large puddles form whenever  rains.  Not sure exactly when  hole started but noticed  partial collapse Sunday.  Looks like water drained somewhere under  alley causing  hole.  Currently cannot get  cars out   driveway due to  hole.  The collapsed section is about 2 - 4 feet wide and 1 - 2 feet deep currently as far as we can tell.  Concerned that more rain will make  much worse and trash trucks driving over  alley re cause collapse more.  Hole  directly under a pipe that doesn't seem to connect to anything that has an iron cover (picture included)

This pot hole is actually a big hole on Coast Walk Trial in La Jolla about 50 yards north from  Cave Shop on Coast Blvd near  Cove ,  is above a sewer/storm water pipes. The erosion has been going on for over two years and reported to Stormwater Dept - Roger Wammack twice.  The hole is eroding  trail wh each rain storm and is now 50%   trail, seriously impacting public safety to  pedestrians who walk  trail. This continues to be left unchecked or repaired and needs immediate attention. The only people trying to rope f  area are locals who know  is a problem including putting cy construction signage and plywood covers, however after  weekend  wood and barriers were tossed in  ocean leaving  growing hole exposed to all who walk  path. Addionally,  addressing  now will cost much less than realigning  trail as was done by Coast Walk Bridge  past year. This is no longer something that can be left to fail w/o serious consequences

A fairly large hole has opened up under part   alley behind my house and caused part   adjacent driveway to collapse.  The hole is under  concrete alley almost directly under where large puddles form whenever  rains.  Not sure exactly when  hole started but noticed  partial collapse Sunday.  Looks like water drained somewhere under  alley causing  hole.  Currently cannot get  cars out   driveway due to  hole.  The collapsed section is about 2 - 4 feet wide and 1 - 2 feet deep currently as far as we can tell.  Concerned that more rain will make  much worse and trash trucks driving over  alley re cause collapse more.  Hole  directly under a pipe that doesn't seem to connect to anything that has an iron cover (picture included)

The road surface along Milton Street from Illion Street going east is riddled wh potholes, although  was resurfaced ltle more than a year ago. Even after a second attempt at fixing  shoddy workmanship  is sub-power and has "fallen apart".  was done in sections  a few blocks, AND one block was left completely unpaved!!!  This was VERY BAD PLANNING. I'm guessing that more than one contractor was used, which would probably account for  planning, wh neir crew taking responsibily for  unpaved block  Milton! I'm not a road paver, but I'd hazard a guess that  preparation   original road surface was lacking proper protocol! I know or residents in  area, and or commuters frequenting  area, submted request to remedy  problem, so I haven't included photos. Many drivers going to Longfellow, Bay Park and School   Madeleine Elementary schools are sorely affected by se potholes wh many families going out  ir way to avoid  section  public roadway.

A massive rectangular sunken pothole has formed in  median lane near Domino's Pizza at 5185 College Ave as College Avenue bisects  SDSU campus.  The pothole is getting  worse by  day.  If a motorist is driving more than 10-15 mph,  pothole is jarring and will damage vehicles. Thousands  vehicles travel  road each day.  A repair is imperative.  During  SDSU Christmas break is a perfect time to repair  pavement due to fewer vehicles from faculty, staff, and students.  This pothole will cost  cy's risk management department a lot  money in repairs if  pothole is not fixed.

I would like to draw the cities attention to the deplorable conditions of the road along side 1725 Dornoch Ct, San Diego, CA 92154, USA between Sanyo Ave and Enrico Fermi Dr ,  section of the road is extremely hazardous and in very poor condition. I am a prison guard and s been almost 10 years of me commmuting to work and not once have I complain. what point is it deem necessary for a tax paying citizen to voice the horrible conditions of the road.The road along  route has been in a dilapidated state due to total neglect of the Department of Roads of San Diego County. There are numerous amounts of potholes causing much difficulty for drivers to navigate though with vehicles. Many passengers including myself fall victims to crack windshields, blown out tires and suspension repair due to the roads conditions.All could easily have been avoided and prevented had the Department of Roads San Diego sector had  Annual inspections.To whom it may concern   would really be appreciated if  matter is

Via Del Campo between W. Bernardo Drive and Via Esprillo are of the most uneven, rutted and pothole littered streets I have encountered in San Diego.  I t appears that most of the damage is from commericial construction from over burdened semis and heavy equipment leave long deep grooves in the pavement.  This is combined with scores of patches of various the majority of which are failing.  Considered that some of San Diegos biggest employers, Sony, HP, Amazon and General omics have offices on  street,  is disgraceful.  Where are all their tax dollars going?

I filed two reports regarding a growing pothole. I was pleased to see that work had been done to repair it. However when I got home yesterday I noticed that  job was simply a patch and was not done properly. As you can see there is still a dip/hole which as you can expect will continue to grow. This work is unacceptable and deserves a quality repair. I hope I will receive notice on how  will be rectified to actually solve the problem and not simply place a bandaid on it.

Today I was driving to Mesa College as  has just stopped raining I encountered a huge problem due to the lack of the Cities part of keeping the street up to drive able conditions.  As there as a pothole full of water which I couldn't avoid due to a car being on the right side of me and the dirt road divider on the left. My tire popped which not only made me late to my class but made me spend over $140 which all could have be avoidable on the city part. After the four hours of waiting to buy a new tire I went back the the pothole parked safely and recorded and took pictures as i tried to give fellow drivers a warning of a huge pothole the size of a swimming pole was in front of them. I extremely disappointed in the City Of San Diego, as a born a raised native I know  could all have been avoided. tached are picture of the damage to my car at the time and picture of the Swimming pool (Pothole) and I also have a video of the car and the impact is having on drivers.  I have also attached my receipt

Westbound on Aero Drive near intersection of Kearny Villa Rd. There is a pothole that has grown exponentially in size since yesterday morning. Large chunks of asphalt are in the roadway (the size of grapefruits), and the hole is so deep that I fear the alignment on my big pickup (that I had done less than a month ago) has been thrown off. I can only imagine what  is doing to smaller vehicles. This is near the area where the sinkhole was reported.  has been filled several times with inadequate amounts of gravel/repair patches. Maybe a more permanent solution could help prevent further erosion. If  is not repaired today, I believe you will have multiple accidents/damages resulting from disregarding it. I believe it could even produce similar sinkhole results like the offramp in the area and needs to be addressed ASAP before more damages ensue.

There's a few potholes at  intersection. Two are in the intersection at the side of La Jolla Village Dr going west.

Another pothole is in the northwest corner of the intersection. If driving south on Genesee and making a right turn onto La Jolla Village Dr, there is a pothole in the middle of that turn. I don't have pictures, but have run over the potholes a few times and it seems like they're getting bigger. Thanks for your help!

Pothole on westbound Genesee turning south on to Linda Vista Road.  Gave me a flat tire . Very big.
The pothole is about  4 inches deep, very dangerous, make people in the traffic lane swerve out of the way which can cause an accident. Since there was a person near my I couldn?t move lanes and I hit the pothole it bent my rim.  So  needs to be fixed fast before anyone else gets injured.

VERY LARGE pothole in left lane of WB Balboa Avenue,  just after you pass over intersection at Clairemont Drive.

I drove over a large pothole on the south side of westbound Genesee Ave (near the center divider curb) just before the left hand turn lane onto Richland Ave at 8:30  a.m.   was filled with water so the depth of it could not be appreciated.   jarred my car significantly and my tire pressure warning light for the front driver tire immediately went on indicating zero pressure; I drove less than a mile to my work and the car was making a grinding noise near the tire.  I called a tow truck and the car is being inspected by the mechanics now but when I inspected the tire after arriving at work, there was 2 large cuts in the tire near the rim and it was flat.  I uploaded the photos of the damage but I've been unable to take a photo of the pothole since I haven't been in my car (I drove w/ the tow truck to the mechanics and Uber gave me a ride back to work.)

There is a large area of damaged (broken, lifting & sinking) portion of a small alley on Valemont/Ullman St. San Diego 92106.  Report # 2483555.  After multiple reports made by neighbors, a city street division inspector photographed and evaluated the street one evening recently.  Truck # 207-237.  He indicated that the scope of the work would be more involved than a pothole.  The area would need to be cut, leveled and a new layer of asphalt applied.  He positioned two large orange cones on top of the problem area. The damaged pavement is in front of my garage. Continues to get worse as trash trucks, UPS, FedX and construction trucks and neighbors use  lane to enter and exit. The alley is a dead end street. I'm concerned about property damage to my house and vehicles. Chunks of asphalt piled up in front of my house. Cones must be moved daily to exit/enter my garage. NO street lights on our alley. Cones alone won't prevent an accident. What is status and time frame for repair work?

The entrance to the Golfview Estates complex from Navajo Road has a pothole between the handicapped ramp that the city put in and the entrance to the driveway. I have seen individuals that are walking and running across Navajo Road and the driveway trip and fall in  area. This pothole was repaired once in 2018. However, we were told a crew was returning to cement over the area. No one ever returned.  This is a hazard to the handicapped individuals that are crossing in the area.  I recently had back surgery and I am walking with a cane. I have fallen in  area myself.  A priority needs to be put on  repair before someone has a debilitating accident. Individuals are also incurring damage on thier cars when they drive into the complex from Navajo Road.

The large bumps in the street at the SE corner of the intersection of La Jolla Shores Drive and Downwind Way have needed attention for over a decade. Now there are safety cones/posts (see photo) there that simply push cyclists into the travel lane just as the bumps did. Please remove the bumps and the posts, which only help to hide a cyclist from the view of drivers on Downwind Way.

Continuos loud metal griding kind of sound is heard whenever I am driving on a freeway. This needs to be repaired to be permently fixed, not just a temporary fix. I also informed the library staff, hoping they will report with more weight.  Please fix it soon.

They are never smooth.  times they put so little asphalt in the hole that the pot hole remain... you need to start doing quality control checks.

The stretch of Harbor Drive between Grape St and the airport has too many potholes to count. I dropped my wife at the airport recently and it felt like Harbor Drive was more of an obstacle course than a road. Apparently a little bit of rain causes all the formerly placed pothole patches to disintegrate. A total repave is really what is needed, any plans in the works? If not, please send out the pothole crew ASAP. And maybe we could find a better quality pothole patch material that does not disintegrate when it gets wet? Thanks in advance for your help. I'm sure it's not your fault our roads are so bad.

The entire street from Mira Mesa blvd, onto Parkdale to Flanders Rd.,  Parkdale is full of holes, cracks and sharp edging that is ripping the tires.   Just before the Elementary School,  at the corner of Flanders and Parkdale,   Jonas Salk Elementary School,  shame on the city of letting  street go so long without being fixed.   Number 2,  at the top of Flanders Place,  a Cul de sac, that's street was repaved last year and now has been ripped by the City,  and  remains in rough stage.
The repair done in response to my pothole report# 02487679 did not hold up and AGAIN THE ROADWAY HAS SUNKEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DAMAGED AREA.    This approx. 5' x 5' needs ANOTHER REPAIR so it will stop being A CONTINUED ROAD HAZARD AGAIN on  high traffic left lane traveling south on Waring Rd.

5 months ago, the subject road was "repaired" between Illion Street and Burgner Blvd.  SO....First rainstorm 3 months ago the road looks similar to what it did before it was repaired.  I put forth a pothole complaint about 6 weeks ago.  I checked on my complaint two weeks ago.  Apparently the complaint was referred to the "paving sub department" for disposition.  I have learned that the city is in dispute with the contractor regarding the previous work.  Meanwhile, the road and those using it suffers further insults. From my perspective, the city should offer the ultimatum either 'fix' the 'repair' or have the city choose another contractor to do the work RIGHT.  As much as my complaint serves my own benefit, it is a matter of principle that America's Finest City proves it EVERY DAY.  I invite a response and more important solving the problem: many holes too little will.  Call me and inform me of the progress.

The north end of Limerick Avenue in Clairemont Mesa is in third world condition.  Nothing has been done north of the 'No Outlet' sign for at least 24 years, the length of time I have lived here.  Cars drag race up to the end and when they discover it is a dead end, they try to U-turn and end up ripping up the pavement.  One car even burst both front tires and tore the pavement up with its rims.  's worse than the pictures, my car's alignment can tell the story.
Please patch up  deep MONSTER pothole that just damaged my tire. Thanks.

A lengthy portion of Garrison Street in Point Loma is in extremely bad condition, with the pavement literally disintegrating in many areas. Garrison is a double yellow line street, the only through street from Chatsworth down to Rosecrans, and a major route to the fishing boat piers. The heavy usage, including a lot of small trucks, has left the pavement in terrible condition. The worst damage is in the long block between Liggett and Clove, but it extends a little further in both directions. We notify the city Street Division regularly about new potholes or large cracks, and get a pretty prompt response, but  is just applying patches to the failing pavement. I know the city has a schedule for repaving streets, but a street that has reached  state of disrepair should become more of a priority. tached is a photo illustrating the condition of the street. I am sending additional photos attached to separate reports due to the size of the files.
This is a continuation of previous report 02502520. See attached photo.

There are at least three deep potholes on the Front Street Exit as you exit 5 South. If you are in the right lane you can not avoid driving into at least one of them.

A line of potholes on the northbound part of Carmel Valley Road just north of Edgewood Bend Ct. This area of Carmel Valley Road was just done!! I believe it was done by a subcontractor for a utility. Whomever it was did a shotty job, and it is unacceptable if utility payers or taxpayers are paying for .  has not even been 3/4 of year that that general area of CV Road was paved. There has got to be some checks and balances for these kinds of things.
MANY potholes on Mission Bay Drive, just south of the Mission Bay/Balboa Ave intersection. Again, why are people like me having to put these requests in?

And why aren't crews attacking these issues w/out the public putting in requests? The roads look worse than ever everywhere in the city I go. Trash all over the freeways too. I never see Caltrans ppl working unless they have the DUI crew. Do those guys actually work?

 9PM on Tuesday, February 5th, my car crossed a trench that was dug in the street by a construction crew. The right lane was blocked with cones, but the trench crossed the remaining open lanes.  The trench was approximately 3 feet wide and 5 inches deep.  My car was moving about 25 MPH, and the trench was so deep with sharp edges that my car bounced and the tire split.  The car behind me also bounced hard through the trench and stopped quickly.  The trench was left in a dangerous condition by the construction crews and cars should not have been allowed to cross it.  I had to replace the tire on my car for $348.  During lunch of the following day, I took the attached picture.  Someone filled the trench with asphalt, so the condition is better than when my car struck the trench, although it still looks dangerous to me.   How can I submit a complaint and request reimbursement for the $348 damage to my vehicle?

I have lived on 71st Street, in the 48 hundred block of that street for over 30 years .   San Diego and La Mesa share   street. The La Mesa side of the street has sidewalks; San Diego  only has sidewalks in a couple of places along the street.   is very unsafe to be walking  on the San Diego side.  La Mesa City came out one time  to make repairs to the street. THEY PAVED THE WHOLE STREET, BUT ONLY THEIR SIDE...they paved from their curbs to the middle of the street. And the San Diego part of the street, to  day, still looks like a 3rd. World road. To be afoot on the San Diego side can be dangerous. Since people must walk in the street, they have to watch out for cars dodging all the POTHOLES!

Potholes are on Princess View Dr, Northbound, from Laura St to Mission Gorge Rd. Starting in front of the first house, 7317 Princess View Dr, left lane, is one that was filled a few months ago, but obviously not properly repaired. The next one is in front of 7331 Princess View Dr, right lane;  one was reported at the same time I reported the first one, but nothing was done. There are a couple more between that one, and the driveway to 7401 Princess View Dr (strip mall), and a couple in front of the strip mall. The worst one is in the right lane just before the intersection with Mission Gorge Rd-- that one is large enough to "catch" a tire if you can't maneuver around it or don't see it.

There is still a large chunk/pothole in the northbound freeway where the wrong-way driver coming up the off-ramp hit that car and caused a major accident several months ago (Aug 2018). The large chunk in the freeway (where the pavement is still black from the fires) not only is dangerous to cars moving at high speeds, but is also a constant reminder of what happened that day (it crosses my mind on a daily basis on my way to work).

You all closed my original request from Jan 24th, 2019 (request number 02492199). I already responded to that "closed" email on Wednesday (2/12)  as your "closed" message says you can respond. I have not heard back from anyone. As I said in that email to you all on Wed there is absolutely no evidence that any work has been done on the stretch of Carmel Mtn Road between 9300-9700 blocks. Both sides, but worse on the westbound side. I had to put my hazards on to get the photos that I'm including  time. One lady almost hit me. I could not get any further down near the preschool because it would have been even more dangerous at that point. Do citizens now need to risk being hit or having their autos hit b/c you guys do lackadaisical jobs?? If your staff does not want to do  job then you need to hire ppl who will.

PER CUSTOMER HAZARDOUS POTHOLE AT THE INTERSECTION.
There has been construction that included a trench cut perpendicular to the roadway on Qualcomm Way heading north just before the Friars Road East onramp. The far right lane with additional construction was marked with orange stanchions as being closed, though the trench continues across the entire 3 lanes. In the center lane heading North on Qualcomm Way, the trench patchwork appeared washed out on the right side of that lane on Friday 2/8/19 at around 12:30pm when I drove my 2010 Mercedes S550 across the trench marks and heard a loud slam from the front right and rear of the vehicle.  that moment the front right tire was rendered flat immediately, and the right rear tire experienced a cut from the rim. Also, upon having the vehicle towed by AAA to the Mercedes Benz of San Diego Dealership the service department determined upon attempting to replace the tires that the front right rim was bent and required replacement, and an alignment would also be necessary. The invoice came to $2,534.74. - Justin Peteris

Now that we had a good rain nearly all the "repair" work has washed away.  Some new holes are deep enough to swallow half an orange road cone, but disguised because they are filled with water.

There was a huge pothole that I hit on my way to work on 02/14/19 and several other cars hit it as well.  was on the corner of E and Union Street by the Edward J. Shwartz Courthouse building. I took a picture of it and my flat tire. I had to call my roadside assistance to get the spare tire put on. I took the picture the day after the incident and an orange cone was already placed next to it. I feel I should be reimbursed for my tire, I was late to work and had to leave early to get a new tire since it was pouring down rain.  was the front tire on the passenger side, The pothole was huge and part of the street was torn up next to it. The hole was so big it damaged the whole tire and the tire couldn't be saved. I am a single mom and I could not afford tires right now. I had to put it on my credit card because that is a big expense right now with having to pay for my son's daycare on the 15th. I would really appreciate if the city would reimburse me for my tire. Thank you so much.

Located by Buca's BACK parking lot/plaza entrance, covering 2 lanes (2nd + 3rd from furthest left), after the light on Westview Parkway & Mira Mesa Blvd heading towards 15-south Freeway for ~100ft. On Thur Feb 14 @~12:30 AM, it had rained all week, I was driving home from my sister's & my car dipped on the driver front side & I heard a loud *thud* that resembled as if I had hit a deep hole. As I approach the interstate 15 South Freeway entrance on Mira Mesa Blvd, I realized something is wrong with my tire/rim & pulled over immediately. The pot hole had severely damaged my tires/rims/suspension. I fear  will happen to another drivers' tires/car/rims. I am still unsure about the estimated cost of repairs as the car is still being looked at. Was told at LEAST $2,500. I would like to file a Damage Claim with the appropriate SD department to see what can be done to help compensate the auto repair costs for the tires, rims, suspension/axles. Thank you so much. I have more pictures of the damage to my vehicle.

These two holes spanning both lanes have been opened multiple times and re-filled.  Each time, the areas have been re-filled, the have not been done properly or completely.  The result is that the material used to fill becomes compacted and the potholes form again.  If city workers are going to open up an area, they need to ensure they fill it properly so that a depression and pothole is not formed.

There is a very dangerous pothole I reported 4 days ago, and it is still there on   heavily traveled street .  now appears both wider and deeper as of  afternoon.  is as bad a pothole as I've seen anywhere. When I hit it, I had to stop my car and check for damage to tires and rims.  is in the right turn lane going west on West Washington by the Chevron gas station which leads directly to the U.S. 5 north on-ramp. Since cars stop there at the light, it is very difficult to see until you hit it very hard. Please fix  before even more people damage their cars or an accident occurs.

Dear Mayor Faulkner, I am writing to you not to complain but to beg for your assistance. I live in Pacific Beach at 1446 Grand Avenue. About 1 year ago the road in front of our home was opened up and new piping was put in. When the resurfaced the section they opened up they did so unevenly. This has caused our home to shake every time a large truck goes by our home. This could be as many as 200 times per day. We have had pictures fall off the walls glasses and frames fall off shelves and my wife and I are awakened dozens of times per night to what often feels like an earthquake. We have lived at  address for 5 years and it was not a problem prior to the road work being done. The weather  winter has made it considerably worse over the past 2 months. We beg you in the name of sanity to assist us.Ray Costello1 446 Grand Avenue 92109858.230.2929

Message from constituent: The City has re-paved nearly all of the streets around here however one of the worst intersections with high traffic (red light waiting can lead up to 10+ cars).

This intersection really needs to be repaired it is really bad and very busy. Just to note it is also a liability as that intersection crosswalks a lot of children to and from school it is a lawsuit just waiting to happen.

On 2/18/19 at 11:10 P.M. I was traveling north on college avenue at the average speed of traffic.  I am a very astute driver but  pothole came into sight at the last possible moment and as was unavoidable, I smashed over  extremely deep, unmarked pothole with such force that I thought it had broken the front end of my Mercedes S500.  An SRS error light immediately illuminated, and has been on since. I pulled over into the college lot immediately after the incident, to surveil the damage.  I believe that it has cause serious wear and tear all across my front end, caused an error with the SRS system, and possibly bent both my rims.  I have been busy working ever since and driving another vehicle, but  will not go unaccounted for

Potholes throughout intersection of Via de la Valle in front of both malls-the Gelson's mall & the Flower Hill mall. Fyi-I tried to put  request in on desktop.

There is something grossly wrong w your online system. This is leading to the public (like me) having to spend more time than I should. And, a waste of time putting it in w the city of Del Mar.

The alley way between Utah and Idaho, behind my townhome on Idaho Street (between the north side of Madison and south side of Adams) has become increasingly dilapidated.  Inevitably a few days after the rain, large pieces of concrete from prior ?patch work? comes loose and exposes pot holes which cause the tires of my vehicle to drop at least 4 inches if driven over.  This makes it nearly impossible to drive in  area and access my home from the Madison side.  Further, avoiding the pot holes has become increasingly difficult as they now extend across the alley.  Additionally, there are many times that accessing my garage is only available via the Madison entrance (rather than the Adams side) due to City waste and recycle vehicles that block the entirety of the alleyway, forcing my path of travel across the dilapidated pothole area of the alley.  I am requesting that the City take more adequate measures to ensure that a complete repair of  area is performed.
